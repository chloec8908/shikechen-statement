  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    I create from emotions.
    <br>
    People use writing to record their diaries; 
    <br>
    I prefer my art to alternate words. 
    <br>
    <br>
    My current stage of making art all comes from a sudden moment of an idea that comes to my mind. It could be from anything else; the daily and surroundings of my life. I took music as one of the importance of my influence in creation. <a class="red" href="https://www.instagram.com/dumplingoftheday/" target="_blank">Inspirations</a> occasionally come from a song that represents the mood of my day. I would use this sense of emotions into building my art visually. I began to cooperate my art with music together and bring vocal to be visual to help my audiences visualize their emotions through this piece of <a>music</a>. Iâ€™ll use my ability to convey my drawing ideas by collecting all the feelings and piecing them into my artwork. It comes to a struggle sometimes when a piece is about an experience that I never have before, and I would have to interpret it in a way from my perspective of my own life experience.
